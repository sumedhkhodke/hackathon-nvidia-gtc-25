What is Nemotron Best For?
NVIDIA Nemotron models are purpose-built for agentic AI - the next generation of intelligent systems that don't just answer questions, but reason, plan, and take action. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, Nemotron excels at:

Advanced reasoning and multi-step problem-solving
Function calling to interact with external tools and APIs
Autonomous decision-making within agent workflows
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for knowledge-based tasks
Multi-agent orchestration where specialized agents work together together
Think beyond chatbots â†’ Build agents that coordinate tasks, use tools intelligently, and adapt to complex scenarios.

ðŸŽ¯ Ideal Projects for This Track
Winning projects will showcase true agentic behavior:

Multi-Agent Systems
Build teams of specialized AI agents (like the Report Generator: Research Agent â†’ Outline Agent â†’ Writer Agent â†’ Editor)

Agentic RAG
Systems that intelligently decide WHEN to retrieve information, not just HOW (perfect for domain-specific assistants)

ReAct Pattern Workflows
Agents that Reason â†’ Act â†’ Observe in loops to solve problems iteratively (like automated debugging or technical support)

Tool-Calling Applications
Leverage Nemotron's exceptional ability to use external APIs and tools (finance analysis, DevOps automation, content creation)

Multi-Modal Agents
Combine Nemotron reasoning with VLMs (visual analysis + logical decision-making)

Agent Simulation & Evaluation
Use Nemotron to generate realistic test scenarios and evaluation pipelines

ðŸ’¡ What Judges Are Looking For
Your project should demonstrate:

âœ…
Autonomous reasoning - not just responding to prompts
âœ…
Multi-step workflows - agents that plan and execute complex tasks
âœ…
Tool integration - using external APIs/services intelligently
âœ…
Real-world applicability - solving actual problems
âœ…
Nemotron-specific strengths - why Nemotron is the right choice
Pro tip: Show the agent's decision-making process in your demo - let judges see it thinking, planning, and acting!
